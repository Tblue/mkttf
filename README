The mkttf.sh script will generate medium (normal), bold and italic versions of the Terminus font.
It will create three directories ("normal", "bold", "italic") in the current working directory.

The fonts are generated using FontForge, which is available from http://fontforge.sf.net .

To run the script (or rather to generate the italic font), you need the mkitalic utility, which is
available from http://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA013651/freeSoftware/mkbold-mkitalic.html .
Make sure it is in your PATH before you invoke mkttf.sh.

The script takes one argument, the directory containing the Terminus BDF files. The italic versions
of the BDF files will be placed there.

Apart from generating TTF fonts, the script will also generate a SFD file (FontForge's native file
format) for each font weight.
